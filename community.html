      <p>Tools from the Floating-point Research World</p>
    </a>

  <p>
    The floating-point research community has developed many tools
    that authors of numerical software can use to test, analyze, or
    improve their code. They are listed here in alphabetical order.
  </p>

  <p><em>Tools on the list are not endorsed, and need not endorse or
  support the FPBench project.</em> The list is intended to be
  exhaustive.</p>

  <dl class="tools-list">
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/4tXJ7f/alive">Alive</a></dt>
    <dd>Alive verifies that LLVM IR optimizations don't change program
    behavior, and includes support for floating-point instructions in
    an extension named LifeJacket. Alive has verified 43 LLVM
    optimizations and discovered eight incorrect ones.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://github.com/rutgers-apl/alive-nj">Alive-NJ</a></dt>
    <dd>Alive-NJ verifies that LLVM IR optimizations don't change
    program behavior, and includes support for floating-point
    instructions. Alive-NJ has found five bugs in LLVM optimization
    passes.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://www.astree.ens.fr/">Astreé</a></dt>
    <dd>Astreé is a static analysis tool for C that can prove the
    absence of runtime exceptions, including in the presence of
    floating-point operations. It has been used to prove the absence
    of runtime exceptions in flight control software for Airbus
    planes.</dd>

    <dd>Fluctuat is a static analysis tool for C that can characterize
    the errors caused by the approximation inherent in floating-point
    arithmetic. Fluctuat has been used to verify safety-critical
    embedded systems.</dd>
