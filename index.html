  <p><a href='https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench'>FPBench</a> is a
  framework for evaluating the accuracy of floating point programs. Our
  goal is to facilitate comparisons and cooperation between tools that help
  programmers write accurate floating point code.</p>

  <p>FPBench currently consists of three parts: a language for expressing benchmarks, a
  benchmark suite written in this language, and a language for describing ways
  to measure floating point error. You can find the current draft of the
  FPBench standards, including FPCore and the measures,
  <a href='spec/fpcore-1.0.html'>here</a>.

  <p>If you're interested in using or helping develop FPBench,
  please consider joining the
