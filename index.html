  <p>FPBench is a community project to facilitate comparisons and
  cooperation between tools that help programmers write accurate
  floating point code.</p>

  <p>FPBench currently consists of three parts: a language for
  expressing benchmarks, a benchmark suite written in this language,
  and a language for describing ways to measure floating point
  error. You can find the current draft of the FPBench standards,
  including FPCore and the measures,
  <a href='spec/fpcore-1.0.html'>here</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're interested in using or helping develop FPBench,
  please consider joining the
  <a href='https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/fpbench'>
    mailing list</a>
  (<a href='https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/pipermail/fpbench/'>archives</a>).
  Currently, the best way to access the existing benchmark suite and tools
  is from the <a href='https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench'>FPBench GitHub repo</a>.

  <p>The first FPBench paper was published at <a href="nsv16.html">NSVâ€™16</a>.</p>
